### Hi there! I'm Eudes and I have a cat called Gris 🐱

I started in the programming area when I was 11 years old when I came across Minecraft servers and their vast world of plugins spread across the Bukkit community, I started to learn Java and became interested in continuing the development of SpotProtection and SpotVip plugins. Since then, I have been looking for my place in the program, I have been improving myself day by day.
