### Hi there! I'm Eudes and I have a cat called Gris 🐱

I'm passionate about game development, software architecture and back-end programming.

I started in the programming area at 11 years old when I came across Minecraft servers and its vast world of plugins spread across the community. Since then, I've been looking for my place in programming, I've been improving day by day.
